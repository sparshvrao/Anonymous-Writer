If you are as lazy as me in writing assignments.Then this is the perfect tool for you .

It converts page from digital text to any given handwriting font you like. Isn't it awesome.

So use this and use your precious saved time in enjoying life.

## How to use ?

              1. Type/Paste the the text you want to convert inside the input below.

              2. Format the text however you like,using the customizations available.

              3. Use the Randomization options at the last, once all changes have been done .

              4. While doing changes to the input Randomizer should be off for the page 
              to function properly .

              5. Try to generate 1 page at a time, multiple pages might take some time to generate .
